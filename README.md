## Weather App

This weather app accepts a latitude and longitude coordinate and returns the forecasted temperature and weather conditions.
The map marker button on the left retrieves the user's current location.

## Future Considerations

Features I would like to add:
- More comprehensive icon system based on more complex "short forecast" parsing
- Ability to choose location from a dropdown list of cities, or choose coordinates by dragging a marker around a map
- Display of forecasted weather for each day of the week, with the ability to expand each day to view the detailed forecast
